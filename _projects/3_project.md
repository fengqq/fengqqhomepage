Cancer therapies often suffer from systemic toxicity or unsatisfactory efficacy, limiting their therapeutic window. To address these challenges, I developed tumor acidity-targeted drug delivery strategies that modify the tissue tropism of therapeutics, thereby expanding the therapeutic window.

For instance, stimulatory cytokines like interleukin-2 (IL-2) can augment lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor responses but are hindered by systemic toxicity. I engineered a strategy to mask IL-2 toxicity in normal tissues, allowing it to be effective only in tumor. This resulted in a new IL-2 therapy with over 100-fold reduced toxicity. This work was recognized with a Young Investigator Award and is currently under further development.

Additionally, I tackled chemotherapy resistance by creating a pH-switchable drug delivery system that improves the retention of chemotherapeutic agents within cancer cells. This system significantly enhances anti-tumor efficacy by ensuring drugs remain inside cancer cells longer, maximizing their therapeutic impact. This approach offers a highly tumor-specific strategy compared to traditional drug design, and therapies based on this technology are under development by biotech companies.
