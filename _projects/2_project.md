Lactate, a key metabolite in glycolytic metabolism, plays a critical role in immune metabolism and is essential for designing immune adjuvants through metabolic regulation. However, lactate has often been confounded with lactic acid and has commonly been regarded as immunosuppressive.

Inspired by the discovery of severe acidity, I hypothesized that lactate's physiological function is masked by the presence of protons. Using single-cell transcriptomics and epigenetic analyses, I revealed that sodium lactate has immune-protective effects by enhancing T cell stemness.

This discovery provides evidence of an unrecognized role for lactate in promoting anti-tumor immunity, apart from the pH-dependent effects of lactic acid. Building on this insight, we developed an acid-responsive negative feedback nanoparticle delivery system that specifically targets lactic acid export in the tumor microenvironment without systemic toxicity. This platform improved immunotherapy (e.g., anti-PD1) outcomes in head and neck cancer and melanoma models.
