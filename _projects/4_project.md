Nanoparticles are promising therapeutic platforms for drug delivery. However, controlling their physical properties—such as size, surface charge, rigidity, and internal structure—is crucial for optimizing their interaction with biological systems and improving therapeutic outcomes.

While microfluidic synthesis is widely used for producing nanoparticles with uniform size and continuous production (a key factor in the clinical translation of lipid nanoparticle-based mRNA vaccines), limited attention has been given to the precise control of nanoparticle structure during synthesis. During my graduate studies, I developed microfluidic technology that allows for the precise control of nanoparticle structures directly on-chip.

I established methods to generate nanoparticles with tunable size, surface charge, rigidity, and core-shell configurations. These structural variations significantly influenced nano-bio interactions and drug delivery efficacy. My research demonstrated that small, rigid nanoparticles exhibit higher cellular uptake and improved tumor targeting efficiency compared to larger or more flexible ones.

This work has important implications for the design of effective drug delivery systems and contributes to advancing the field of nanomedicine.
