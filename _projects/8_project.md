Science has traditionally been perceived as an exclusive domain accessible only to those with advanced degrees and specialized training. However, the democratization of scientific knowledge and participation is crucial for fostering innovation, public understanding, and inspiring the next generation of researchers.

I am passionate about creating platforms and initiatives that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and diverse audiences. This includes developing educational programs that connect high school students with real scientific projects, creating accessible tools for citizen science, and building communities where anyone with curiosity can contribute to scientific discovery.

The goal is to break down barriers and create inclusive spaces where people from all backgrounds can engage with science meaningfully, whether through hands-on participation in research projects, interactive learning experiences, or collaborative problem-solving initiatives.
