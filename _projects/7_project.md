Single cell analysis has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and disease mechanisms. However, the computational complexity and technical barriers associated with analyzing large-scale single cell datasets often limit accessibility for researchers without extensive coding experience.

I am developing comprehensive toolkits that democratize single cell research by eliminating the need for programming skills while maintaining analytical rigor. These platforms provide intuitive graphical interfaces for data preprocessing, quality control, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization of single cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and spatial transcriptomics datasets.

## iSNAP: Interactive Single-cell No-coding Analysis Pipeline

iSNAP is a user-friendly platform that provides a complete workflow for single cell data analysis without requiring any coding expertise. The platform incorporates automated workflows for common analysis tasks while maintaining flexibility for advanced users.
