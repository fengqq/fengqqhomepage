Dr. Qiang Feng received his Bachelor’s (2012) and Master’s (2014) degrees in Pharmaceutics from Peking University and earned his Ph.D. (2017) in Nanoscience and Technology from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He completed his postdoctoral training with Professor Jinming Gao at UT Southwestern, where he is now an Assistant Professor.

Dr. Feng’s research focuses on the abundance and immunological roles of key metabolites in the tumor microenvironment. By developing multi-chromatic pH nanosensors with high spatial resolution, he uncovered the presence of severely polarized extracellular acidity (pHe < 5.3) surrounding tumor cells—over an order of magnitude more extreme than previously recognized (Nature Biomedical Engineering, 2024). Integrating cancer biology, clinical insights, and immune metabolism, he demonstrated that this severe acidity acts as a potent but underappreciated immunosuppressor, while sodium lactate, its anionic counterpart, has immune-protective properties (Nature Communications, 2022). These findings led to the development of acidity-targeted immunotherapy nanodrugs and metabolism-regulating immune adjuvants.

To date, Dr. Feng has authored over 30 peer-reviewed publications in leading journals, with more than 4,000 citations, and holds three patents for his discoveries.
