- title: Summary of Contributions
  type: list
  contents:
    - My research centers on exploring the abundance and immunological functions of key metabolites in tumors. By designing multi-chromatic pH nanosensors with high spatial resolution, I uncovered the presence of severely polarized acidity (pHe<5.3) around tumor cellsâ€”more than one order of magnitude higher than previous understanding (Nature Biomed. Eng. 2024).    - By combining insights from cancer biology, clinical observations, and immune metabolism, I demonstrated that severe acidity is an underestimated immunosuppressor, while sodium lactate, as its anionic counterpart, plays a previously unrecognized immune-protective role (Nature Commun. 2022).
     I further led the development of multiple acidity-targeted immunotherapy nanodrugs and tumor metabolism-regulating immune adjuvants based on these findings.
     To date, I have published over 30 peer-reviewed papers in leading journals such as Nature Biomed. Eng. and Nature Commun., accumulating over 4,000 citations. I have also filed three patents for my discoveries.
     In addition to the scientific innovation, I have also mentored students from diverse backgrounds and will continue to train a diverse group of young scientists, providing them with the tools and mentorship to succeed in cancer research.
